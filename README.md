## Project Overview

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust brain tumor detection system using various deep learning models. We aimed to compare the performance of different architectures and improve upon existing methods by incorporating advanced models and techniques.

### Models Used

- **Swin Transformer**: A transformer-based model for image classification and detection tasks.
- **ResNet152**: A deep residual network with 152 layers, known for its high accuracy in image classification tasks.
- **MobileNetV2**: A lightweight model designed for efficient mobile and edge device applications.
- **DenseNet121**: A densely connected convolutional network that improves gradient flow and feature reuse.
- **Xception**: An architecture that applies depthwise separable convolutions for efficient learning.
- **ResNet50V2**: An improved version of ResNet50 with enhanced performance.
- **ResNet101**: A deep residual network with 101 layers, providing a balance between depth and performance.

### Performance Metrics

We evaluated the performance of each model using several metrics:
- **Loss**: The measure of how well the model's predictions match the ground truth.
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Precision**: The measure of the model's ability to correctly identify positive cases.
- **Recall**: The measure of the model's ability to identify all positive cases.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation metric.

### Research and Analysis

- **Literature Review**: An extensive review of existing research on brain tumor detection and deep learning techniques.
- **Model Comparison**: Detailed analysis and comparison of the performance of various models, including experiments with adding noise to images to introduce new challenges.
